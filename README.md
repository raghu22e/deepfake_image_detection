The project majorly focos on the deep fkae image detion for the video footages,the video will be detecting by spliting into the farmes as showen in results, so we can say that these project not only deting for the video it can also detect for the single image even.
The predection is doen by the deep future extraction while training and testing the model, this prrocess will come under the binary classification because tehre are only 2 classes that need to classified into one class only 
for these  we used the inceptionv3 model which is better for image classification 

The sample video output of the code is beeing insterted hear

The output will be

THe procees or the steps need to follow is 

Step1: Downlode the repository and unzip the reposty 

*** While unziping the folders make sure you unzip the model forlder also as the model is uploded zip due to size constrantes*****
Step2: After downlode the reposotory change the paths according to ur local directory of "my_model.h5"

step3: After that  open your teminal and with the woring directory and enter the command "python app.py"

Step4: After taking a couple of time there will be a link as the output to go to your web page

***ignore the Warnings that came*****

Step5: once the web page open uplode the video as showen in the video(1) and wait for the result


THE VIDEO WILL BE SPLITING INTO FRMES AND THE MODEL PROCESS THE FRAMES AND GIVE TEH OUTPUT THAT PROCESSING OF FRAMES CAN BE SEEN IN THE COMAND PROMT WHERE YOU ENTRED THE COMANDS AS SHOWED IN BELOW FIGURE
